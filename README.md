# killfeed_bot

## Description
This app creates a Discord killfeed bot for the game DayZ. The code parses through the server's logs on Nitrado(server hosting service) and when a kill is detected,
it sends a message of the kill to a discord guild channel. It also has a command that returns the amount of players currently on the server, along with their
gamertags(called by "!players").
